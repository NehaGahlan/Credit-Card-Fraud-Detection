Ensemble Learning Methods to predict fraud
This project was implemented to discover the performances of the Ensemble Learning family models on unbalanced datasets. The classifiers implemented are: Random Forest, AdaBoost and XGBoost and finally Ensemble Vote Classifier.Finally, to compare models of the Machine Learning family, I created a single layer neural network in the Deep Learnign field.
